The New Jersey birds web app is designed for NJ bird enthusiasts and new birders to discover the birds living in their backyard! Check out the dictionary to discover and learn more about each bird from their description, to image, to bird call. Then, test yourself in the practice to see if you really know how to identify the bird.
